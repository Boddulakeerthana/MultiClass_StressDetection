# MultiClass_StressDetection Through Heart Rate Variability
This project focuses on detecting stress or no stress using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data. The system analyzes physiological signals and applies machine learning techniques to identify whether a person is experiencing stress or is in a normal state.

Unlike multiclass prediction, this project works on binary classification, making the model simple, efficient, and suitable for real-world health monitoring applications.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build a machine learning model that can accurately classify stress levels into:

-Stress

-No Stress

using HRV parameters extracted from physiological data.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

-Python

-Machine Learning

-NumPy & Pandas – Data handling

-Scikit-learn – Model training and evaluation

-Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

## 🧠 How It Works

HRV data is collected and preprocessed

Important HRV features are extracted

Machine learning models are trained on labeled data

The system predicts whether the user is stressed or not

## 📈 Use Cases

Mental health monitoring

Early stress detection

Wellness and healthcare applications

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Real-time stress detection

Integration with wearable devices

Web or mobile-based interface

## 🌱 Conclusion

This project highlights how machine learning and HRV data can help in understanding stress patterns and supporting mental well-being through technology.
